                        <p>Stream and watch the anime Attack on Titan on Crunchyroll.

                        <p>December 8, 1994 was the last day that anything was known about the whereabouts of the scientist. The mystery surrounding his disappearance is due to the irregularities of the case. The incident occurred four days before his 48th birthday. It is known that his wife, Teresa Mendoza, did not inform the authorities because her husband often went on trips without notifying anyone.

                        <p>The Illuminati conspiracy stretches as far back as 1st May 1776 – which was the day it was supposedly founded. It is thought the secret society’s goal is to oppose the abuse of state power, religious influence, superstition, prejudice, whilst supporting women’s education and gender equality. The Illuminati may attempt to control world events, whilst striving to gain power and influence to establish a New World Order.

                        <h2>What are the lizard people?</h2>
                        <p>Lizard people are cold-blooded humanoid reptilians who have the power to shape-shift into human form. According to David Icke, a new-age philosopher and one of the most prominent theorists in the lizard people game, these creatures have had their claws in humankind since ancient time, and world leaders like Queen Elizabeth, George W. Bush, the Clintons, and Bob Hope are all lizard people.

What made her famous were her inexplicable healings, even for doctors and scientists, and the way she materialized organs "out of thin air."

                        <h2>Life after death</h2>
                        <p>Religious texts and teachings frequently bring the soul into the discussion. What some perceive as soul boils down to consciousness that assists us in being ‘us.’ Soul is believed to exist beyond the laws of life and death. It is postulated that our soul existed before we did and will exist after we do not. However, this concept becomes feeble when looked through a scientific spectacle.
